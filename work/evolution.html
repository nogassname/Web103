                <p align="left">Communication is very important. It is a key to
                    understanding between people. Through the years, 
                    communication has evolved. The way people communicate with each other 
                   today is entirely different from the prehistoric era. </p>
       
                   <p align="right">Technology has indeed redefined communication. 
                       People no longer have to wait for years, months, weeks, and days to receive 
                       an information or message. Today, texts, e-mails, tweets, and personal messages 
                       can reach the recipient in just a matter of seconds.</p>

                <p>Telegraph communication started after Samuel Morse invented the Morse code which encoded the ISO
