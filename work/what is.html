            <h2>What is communication ?</h2>
            <p  style="border: 1px black solid; padding:10px ;">Communication is the process of sending and 
                receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal 
                means, including speech, or oral communication; 
                writing and graphical representations signs, signals, 
                and behavior. More simply, communication is said 
                to be "the creation and exchange of meaning."</p>
             <p>Communication methods are something that we have used 
                    since the beginning of time itself to convey absolutely everything.</p>

                <h2>Communication at light speed</h2>
                <p style="border: 1px black solid; padding:10px ;">We invented fiber optic cable and this transmits data at near
                      the speed of light. That's a 186,000 miles per second and it
                       is the universal speed limit so now it's not so much about speed, 
                       it's about throughput. Throughput refers to how much data can be 
                       transferred from one location to another in a given amount of time. 
                       That's how much data you can shove through a length of cable at 
                       a given amount of time. And we've gotten really good at that too.
                        <br>In 2012,communications companies got together and built
                         a 12-core fiber optic cable capable of carrying one petabit
                      of information per second across 30 miles.
